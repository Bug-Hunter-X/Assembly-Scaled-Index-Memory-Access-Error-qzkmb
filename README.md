This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming related to memory access using scaled indices.  The `bug.asm` file contains code exhibiting the potential problem. The correct usage is shown in `bugSolution.asm`.  Incorrect scaling factors or addresses can lead to segmentation faults or data corruption. The solution emphasizes careful calculation and validation of memory addresses.
